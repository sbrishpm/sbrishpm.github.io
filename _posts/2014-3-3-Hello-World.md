Physics and Mathematics Rules
#######

Hello Viewers,

#######

This blog is dedicated to physics and mathematics!

As you know it today is mothers day. I dedicate this blog to my mother and father.

**Dear Mom,
 You are the best mother a child could have, thy love for me is infinite and I love you a lot too. I love you as much as the rate of fasterness of the whole universe. I thaank you for everything you have done, from motivating me to giving me advise. I love you so much, that no one human in this planet can express. I love you so much!

**Love,
	Rish**
